# sv-pl-keyboard-layout
Standard Swedish keyboard layout with Polish letters added to their usual location. Useful for people using Swedish keyboards to write in both Swedish and Polish without having to switch their keyboard layout.

The layout works just like a standard Swedish layout.

But when holding right alt (alt-gr), it can be used like the Polish "programmers" layout.
